    <li class="intro-paragraph"> <p>Hello! My name is Sarah! I’m so excited to embark on this journey with you all and learn everything I can about the coding world. I recently moved back to the Tampa area with my parents. Before moving here, I was working as a “web developer” in Raleigh, North Carolina. Web developer was my official job title, however, I was just making websites using platforms like Duda, Wix, and Shopify. So, I would definitely not call myself a proper developer. That <em>developer</em> job that I luckily stumbled across one day on Indeed gave me my first taste of the tech world, and I loved it. It also inspired me to join DigitalCrafts and learn how to make websites and applications without the help of a platform like Wix. </p></li>
